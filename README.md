# Neural Machine Translation

I have built a language model that is used to translate German sentences to English sentences based on Natural Language Processing. I have build the model using Neural Networks from python's keras library. I have used LSTM (Long Short term memory) an RNN to build the model. This project is under progress and I aim to get a better accuracy.
